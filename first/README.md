# Mazes - Search Algorithms

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the implementation and analysis of various pathfinding algorithms in mazes. It is divided into four parts:

## Implementation Breakdown

### Part 1: Maze Construction
We constructed mazes using algorithms that create multiple paths between two points (start and finish). Our goal was to ensure that each maze has at least two distinct routes. We modified an existing maze generation algorithm and provided a brief description of our chosen method and implementation.

### Part 2: Pathfinding with A*
This section involved implementing the A* algorithm to find the shortest paths between nodes in the mazes created in Part 1. We explored different cost functions, including real distances and heuristic estimates, to analyze their impact on the algorithm's performance. We experimented with various configurations to determine which heuristic functions yielded the best results.

### Part 3: Performance Evaluation
Here, we compared the efficiency of the pathfinding algorithms implemented in Part 2 based on their complexity and effectiveness in finding optimal paths. We generated multiple mazes of varying sizes and collected data on the shortest path lengths and the number of expanded nodes.

### Part 4: Manual Maze Creation and Testing
In the final part, we manually created five specific mazes and analyzed how different algorithms performed in these scenarios. Each maze was accompanied by an explanation of our design choices and the outcomes of running the pathfinding algorithms. We also visualized the algorithms' behavior through animations.
